motetrack_ori : most direct translation from original C version to Java, except for the powerlevel arrays which are already eliminated.
                doesn't run because it runs out of memory very quickly.
motetrack     : original C version, and Java version modified by replacing the 2-element arrays in RFSignal and RFSignalAvg with 2 separate variables.
motetrack_opt : Several 'unfair' optimisations, C version modified to match the Java optimisations.
